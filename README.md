## Outline

This directory contains 5 scripts:

1. rgrowth_model.R: the script that runs the model (generates a set of species abundances and samples/degrades the data outputting multiple datasets per run)
2. force_funcs_1.1.R: a set of functions that generate environmental drivers/forcings
3. force_scaling_funcs_1.1.R: additional functions to scale the values of drivers
4. rgrowth_model_funcs.R: a set of functions that generate species parameters and calculate species abundances given a set of environmental forces/drivers
5. degradation_funcs_1.1.R: a set of functions for sampling, degrading and age-depth modelling of the species data

To run the model with example input parameters, open the rgrowth_model.R file and run the entire script. This will generate and save multiple data files. The file of interest from a single model run will be named all_output.rds. This file includes everything generated by the model including each level of sampling and degradation applied to the species data. 

This set of scripts is the code version used to generate the data included in the associated paper. Data for the paper were generated on New Zealand eScience Infrastructure's (NeSI) HPC; thus, minor modifications were necessary to provide a self-contained script that will  run locally. A newer version is in production with the same mathematical structure but more efficient programming. Please do not hesitate to contact the primary author for any details:
